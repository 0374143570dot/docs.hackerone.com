These metrics give hackers a better idea of how responsive a program is. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bounty Statistics</h3>\n<p>Bounty metrics are calculated over a programâ€™s lifetime and set realistic expectations with hackers and security teams. You can view:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total bounties paid</li>\n<li>Average bounty (Displayed as a range from the 45th to 55th percentile)</li>\n<li>Top bounty (Displayed as a range from the 90th to 100th percentile)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Total bounties paid can be a strong indicator that a bounty program is active and healthy. The mean and median bounty also serve as rough guidance for how much a hacker can expect in return for a valid report. </p>\n<p><em>Note: Any reports filed by a security team\'s members will not be reflected in the metrics.</em></p>',frontmatter:{path:"/programs/program-metrics",title:"Program Metrics"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
