To change their settings for invitations, they can contact HackerOne support. </p>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>URLs in the report title are now wrapped so that they aren’t crossing out of the inbox. </li>\n<li>The Program Health Dashboard now displays 0 instead of N/A when there are no missed or failed reports. </li>\n<li>When a hacker leaves a program that they got invited to through the email forwarding feature, they won’t be placed in the priority queue for leaving that program. This prevents hackers from harvesting a ton of private invitations. </li>\n<li>Hackers now don’t receive invitations to programs they’ve left. </li>\n<li>When hackers received an invitation to claim a report, they couldn’t see or accept the terms of the program. Now they can actually claim the report and see the terms of the program. </li>\n</ul>",frontmatter:{path:"/changelog/2018/april",title:"April 2018"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
