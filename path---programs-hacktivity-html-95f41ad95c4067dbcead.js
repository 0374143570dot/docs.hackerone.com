Anyone with an account can upvote, but you can only upvote once on each activity. When you hover over the upvote count, you can see the top 10 hackers (ranked by Signal) that voted on the activity.</p>\n<p>There is currently no downvoting capability, but you can retreat your upvote by clicking on the arrow again.</p>\n<h3>How is Activity Ranked on Hacktivity?</h3>\n<p>Activities on each page are ranked differently.</p>\n<p>On the <strong>Popular</strong> page, activities are ranked by calculating the number of upvotes divided by (a power of the time since they were last updated on Hacktivity). The vote is weighted slightly more if it comes from a hacker with high Signal. Additionally, each activity gets an initial boost if it is resolved and/or receives an above average bounty.</p>\n<p>On the <strong>New</strong> page, activities are ordered chronologically with the latest activity being listed on top. A previously appeared vulnerability goes back to the top when there is new activity on the report.</p>\n<p>If you want to see downvoting, a commenting feature, or a new feature request, send <a href="mailto:feedback@hackerone.com">HackerOne a feature request</a>.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/programs/hacktivity.html",id:"programs/hacktivity",title:"Hacktivity",description:null}}},pathContext:{}}}});
