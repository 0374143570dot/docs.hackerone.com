If a vulnerability were successfully exploited, this metric measures the impact of the confidentiality of the information that is at risk. To set the confidentiality level of the asset, you can choose from these 4 options:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Option</th>\\n<th>Details</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>None</td>\\n<td>There's no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Low</td>\\n<td>There's some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker doesn't have control over what information is obtained or the amount or kind of loss that's constrained. The information disclosed doesn't cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Medium</td>\\n<td>In between Low and High</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>High</td>\\n<td>There's a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h4>Integrity</h4>\\n<p>Integrity refers to the trustworthiness of information. This metric measures the impact to the integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. To set the integrity level of the asset, you can choose from these 4 options:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Option</th>\\n<th>Details</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>None</td>\\n<td>There's no loss of integrity within the impacted component.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Low</td>\\n<td>Modification of data is possible, but the attacker doesn't have control over the consequence of a modification. The amount of modification may be constrained, and there isn't a direct, serious impact on the affected component.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Medium</td>\\n<td>In between Low and High</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>High</td>\\n<td>There's a total loss of integrity or a complete loss of protection due to the vulnerability. For example, the attacker is able to modify any or all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h4>Availability</h4>\\n<p>Availability refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component.  To set the availability level of the asset, you can choose from these 4 options:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Option</th>\\n<th>Details</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>None</td>\\n<td>There's no impact to the availability within the impacted component.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Low</td>\\n<td>There's reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker doesn't have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Medium</td>\\n<td>In between Low and High</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>High</td>\\n<td>There's a total loss of availability resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component. This loss is either sustained (the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has finished). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. For example, the attacker can't disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections, the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks only a small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/programs/environmental-score.html\",\"id\":\"programs/environmental-score\",\"title\":\"Environmental Score\",\"description\":null}}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---programs-environmental-score-html-2a6f9efd57eefec04ebb.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>The environmental score enables you to set the maximum <a href=\\\"severity.html\\\">severity</a> of an asset.
