The index calculates 6 dimensions by which programs can benchmark their success each month. Learn more <a href="https://hackerone.com/blog/success-in-vulnerability-disclosure">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Disclosure Assistance</h3>\n<p>We provide hackers with the ability to request help in contacting an organization with a vulnerability through Disclosure Assistance. This enables HackerOne to take steps to identify the organization’s official vulnerability reporting process. Read more in our <a href="https://hackerone.com/blog/vulnerability-disclosure-assistance">blog</a>.</p>\n<h3>Trigger: Show Interstitial</h3>\n<p>We’ve updated our triggers functionality so that an interstitial shows prior to report submission. This helps hackers to avoid the submission of a number of out-of-scope or commonly reported false positives.</p>\n<h3>Automated Scanner Detection</h3>\n<p>We’ve updated our report classification engine to detect common outputs from automated vulnerability scanners that are frequently flagged as invalid. This enables the quality of report submissions to improve as hackers can check the report before submission.</p>\n<h3>Single Sign-On: SAML</h3>\n<p>We’ve improved our Single-Sign-On (SSO) options with support for SAML. Response teams using an SSO provider to authenticate can use those services for centralized authorization and identity management.</p>\n<h3>Suggest a Bounty</h3>\n<p>There’s now a reward suggestion functionality where program members can suggest bounty amounts. This enables programs to more easily arrive at a consensus regarding award amounts.</p>\n<h3>Report Abuse</h3>\n<p>If any disagreements or discussions arise regarding a report, hackers and programs can now request mediation and our experts will provide guidance on the situation.</p>\n<h3>Group Assignments</h3>\n<p>The group assignments feature enables programs to assign reports to a team rather than just to an individual so that multiple people within a team have the ability to pick up the report.</p>\n<h3>Improved Report Meta Data</h3>\n<p>We’ve updated the styling between the report meta data and the summary/timeline so that the report meta data is now collapsible.   </p>\n<h3>New Integrations</h3>\n<p>We’ve added integrations with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slack</li>\n<li>Redmine</li>\n<li>Freshdesk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read more about how these integrations work <a href="https://docs.hackerone.com/programs/supported-integrations.html">here</a>.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/changelog/2015/november",title:"November 2015"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
