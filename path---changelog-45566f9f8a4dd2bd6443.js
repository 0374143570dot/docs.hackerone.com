The feedback can be viewed at <b>Dashboard > Feedback</b>. <a href="/programs/hacker-feedback-dashboard.html">Learn more about the feedback dashboard</a>. </p>\n<h3>Triggers</h3>\n<p>We\'ve revamped our triggers functionality so that you can: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Preview matches for a new trigger</li>\n<li>Add <i>And/Or</i> conditionals to make the trigger more flexible</li>\n<li>Edit or build off of default triggers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\'ve also updated the design so that you\'ll have a better user experience.\n<a href="/programs/triggers.html">Learn more about triggers</a>.</p>\n<h3>Response Targets</h3>\n<p>We’ve deprecated the term, <i>Response SLA</i> and replaced it with Response Targets and Response Standards. <a href="/programs/response-targets.html">Learn more about these new terms</a>. </p>\n<p>We’ve deprecated the <i>SLA Violations</i> inbox view and changed the name to <b>Missed targets</b>. The inbox filters are also now <b>Missed response targets</b> and <b>Missed response standards</b> instead of <i>SLA violation reports</i> and <i>SLA Fail reports</i>. </p>\n<p>We introduce 4 new inbox labels for reports that don’t meet response standards or targets. The labels are: Response, Triage, Bounty, and Resolve. These labels replace the previous <i>SLA Fail</i> and <i>SLA Miss</i> labels. </p>\n<p>The fields on the Reponse Target performance section of the Program Health dashboard have changed to <b>On target</b>, <b>Missed target</b>, and <b>Missed standard</b>. The missed target line is also taken off of the Average Time to Resolution graph on the dashboard.</p>\n<h3>Response Efficiency Indicators</h3>\n<p>We’ve modified response efficiency indicators so that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They now let you know the program’s percentage of reports that meet response standards instead of the number of reports that are failing or missing SLAs. </li>\n<li>The indicator and metrics are visible even when a member of the program is signed out. </li>\n<li>The orange response efficiency indicator is now changed to yellow.</li>\n<li>The indicator now occurs at the bottom of the metrics chart instead of at the top.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Time to Resolution by Severity</h3>\n<p>We now enable you to set your Time to Resolution response standards by severity. Learn more <a href="/programs/setting-response-targets.html">here</a>. </p>\n<h3>Invitations Toggle</h3>\n<p>Programs no longer have the ability to toggle invitations on or off with the On/Off button. The equivalent action to turn invitations off is to set the report volume to 0 if they no longer wish to engage with new hackers. To turn invitations on, just increase the report volume to be greater than 0. </p>\n<h3>Policy and Scope</h3>\n<p>Policy and Scope now have their own separate sections under <b>Settings > Program</b>. </p>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Managed label no longer shows up on the directory for programs with expired triage subscriptions.</li>\n<li>The response standard percentage now displays when the display option setting is enabled. There were some incidences where it didn’t show in the past. </li>\n<li>When a large user profile photo is uploaded, an error message is now given to the user to notify them that the upload has failed. </li>\n<li>Social sharing icons on public programs are now aligned and work properly without any weird spacing issues between the icons. </li>\n<li>Hackers no longer receive automatic invitations for programs they’ve left. </li>\n</ul>',frontmatter:{path:"/changelog/2018/may",title:"May 2018",date:"2018-05"}}},{node:{html:"<h3>The 90 Day Leaderboard</h3>\n<p>The new rolling 90 day leaderboard ranks hackers based on their score from this calculation: <strong>Reputation x Signal Percentile x Impact Percentile</strong>. </p>\n<h3>Needs More Info</h3>\n<p>When a program member adds a comment to an open report with a question mark, Hackbot will prompt them asking if they want to change the state of the report to Needs more info. </p>\n<h3>Response Efficiency Timers</h3>\n<p>Response efficiency timers no longer trigger for reports submitted by internal members of the program. </p>\n<h3>Auto-Invites for Controlled Programs</h3>\n<p>Programs in controlled launch mode are no longer able to toggle auto-invites as on or off. To change their settings for invitations, they can contact HackerOne support. </p>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>URLs in the report title are now wrapped so that they aren’t crossing out of the inbox. </li>\n<li>The Program Health Dashboard now displays 0 instead of N/A when there are no missed or failed reports. </li>\n<li>When a hacker leaves a program that they got invited to through the email forwarding feature, they won’t be placed in the priority queue for leaving that program. This prevents hackers from harvesting a ton of private invitations. </li>\n<li>Hackers now don’t receive invitations to programs they’ve left. </li>\n<li>When hackers received an invitation to claim a report, they couldn’t see or accept the terms of the program. Now they can actually claim the report and see the terms of the program. </li>\n</ul>",frontmatter:{path:"/changelog/2018/april",title:"April 2018",date:"2018-04"}}},{node:{html:'<h3>Invitations</h3>\n<p>We’ve improved the way programs can manage their invitations to hackers.
