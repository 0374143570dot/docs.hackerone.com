As sharing knowledge is key toward advancing our collective ability to improve security, sharing what you’ve learned and discovered is one small way to give back to the community.</p>\n<h3>Requirements for Publishing an External Vulnerability</h3>\n<p>In order to publish a report, all these requirements must be met:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Requirement</th>\n<th>Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>The posting must describe a vulnerability.</td>\n<td>A vulnerability is a weakness of software, hardware, or online service that can be exploited to cause harm.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>You (the publisher) must be the finder of the vulnerability.</td>\n<td>You can’t post other hackers’ findings under your own name - that’s their work!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The vulnerability must have already been responsibly disclosed to the security team of the associated organization.</td>\n<td>You must have established communication with the security team responsible for the product or service, and received agreement from the security team that you may publish the vulnerability after resolution.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The vulnerability must be resolved.</td>\n<td>The security team must have confirmed with you that they’ve resolved the vulnerability and provided updates and patches to their users (if applicable). We don’t support nor permit you to post about 0-days or exploits that may be used to harm others.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The associated organization has given you consent to publicly share the vulnerability.</td>\n<td>Hacktivity is a channel for coordinated disclosures. Full disclosure has its time and place, and this isn’t the place for that. \n<br>\n<br>\nThe organization must consent to having their information for this particular vulnerability posted publicly.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>You adhere to our Code of Conduct and other HackerOne policies.</td>\n<td>Find our hacker’s code of conduct at: \n<a href="https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines">https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines</a>\n \n<br>\n<br>\nFind our Copyright and IP Policy at: \n<a href="https://www.hackerone.com/dmca">https://www.hackerone.com/dmca</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>By publishing vulnerabilities to HackerOne, you acknowledge that you’ve met all of the above requirements.  </p>\n<h3>Publishing a Vulnerability on Hackerone</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve met all of the requirements above, you’re ready to publish your vulnerability. To publish an external vulnerability on HackerOne:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the Directory.</li>\n<li>Find the organization you want to publish a vulnerability for. You can refine your search results by entering <code>type:external [name of organization]</code>.</li>\n<li>Select the organization.   </li>\n<li>Click the green <b>Publish vulnerability</b> button.</li>\n<li>Fill out the Publish vulnerability report form.</li>\n<li>Click <b>Publish vulnerability</b>.</li>\n<li><i>(Optional)</i> Add a summary to your report. You can always come back and edit the summary.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The report will publish onto the <b>New</b> page of Hacktivity and have a <b>Published</b> icon on it to distinguish it from other reports. Users can upvote your report in Hacktivity, and the report will also display on your hacker profile.</p>\n<p><i>Note: HackerOne reserves the right to remove any posted content if any party informs us that the content didn’t meet our requirements for publishing. <br><br>Publishing currently doesn’t influence <a href="https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/reputation.html">Reputation</a> or your eligibility for any bounties.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Publishing External Vulnerabilities",id:"hackers/publishing-external-vulnerabilities",path:"/hackers/publishing-external-vulnerabilities.html",description:null}}},pathContext:{}}}});
