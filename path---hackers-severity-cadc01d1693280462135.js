The CVSS enables there to be a common languange around the severity of bugs. You can either choose a severity level based on their own judgment of the vulnerability, or you can use the CVSS calculator to give more information about the vulnerability and calculate an exact CVSS score. </p>\n<p>The CVSS Calculator provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produces a numerical score reflecting its severity. The numerical score can then be translated into a qualitative representation to help properly assess and prioritize inbound vulnerabilities. </p>\n<p>There are 8 metrics defined for CVSS v3. The first 5 are about the attack method itself, while the latter three are dependent on how your program assesses impact - the direct consequence of a successful exploit. These are the different components to the CVSS Calculator:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Detail</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Attack Vector</td>\n<td>How exploitable the vulnerability is. The score increases the more remote an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Attack Complexity</td>\n<td>The conditions beyond the attacker\'s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Privilege Required</td>\n<td>The level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The severity increases as fewer privileges are required.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User Interaction</td>\n<td>Whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some matter.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scope</td>\n<td>Whether a successful attack impacts a component other than the vulnerable component.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Confidentiality</td>\n<td>The impact of the bug as it relates to confidential information being accessed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Integrity</td>\n<td>Whether the the data can be modified due to the vulnerability.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Availability</td>\n<td>Whether data or functionality can be rendered inaccessible. The impact to the availability of the impacted component.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src="./images/severity-2.png" alt="severity-2"></p>\n<p><em>Note: It\'s optional for you to submit a severity rating.</em> </p>\n<p>You can read more details about CVSS <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide">here</a>. </p>\n<p>If the program has a custom methodology for determining severity, it should be described it on their Security Page.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/hackers/severity",title:"Severity"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
