Check out the security pages for Yahoo!, Twitter, and Dropbox for reference.</p>\n<h3>Claiming the Security Page</h3>\n<p>Unless a security page is claimed, the page is curated by the HackerOne community. An organization can claim their security page in order to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take editorial control of their disclosure policy</li>\n<li>Self-update their information</li>\n<li>Own their policy messaging</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You don\'t have to be a HackerOne customer in order to claim a Security Page, though signing up for a free HackerOne account is necessary.</p>\n<p>To claim a security page:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Find an unclaimed security page in the directory. </p>\n<p>*Note: Unclaimed pages have the <strong>Claim this page</strong> and the <strong>Sugesst edits</strong> link on the right.* <img src="https://github.com/Hacker0x01/docs.hackerone.com/blob/master/docs/programs/images/security%20page-1.png?raw=true" alt="security page-1"></p>\n<p><em>Claimed pages don\'t have the link available.</em> </p>\n<p><img src="https://github.com/Hacker0x01/docs.hackerone.com/blob/master/docs/programs/images/security%20page-2.png?raw=true" alt="security page-2"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the <strong>Claim this page</strong> link. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A HackerOne staff will either approve or reject your claim request. If your request is approved, you\'ll be given editing rights to the entire page.  </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>HackerOne reviews each claim submission for validity before granting the claim. A security page can only be claimed once. Once you claim your security page, the community can no longer edit it.</p>\n<p>*Note: Hackers looking to claim a page need to be above a certain reputation threshold to be given direct editing rights. If they don\'t have rights, they can suggest changes which will get reviewed and approved by HackerOne staff. </p>\n<h3>Suggesting Edits on the Security Page</h3>\n<p>You can suggest edits to any unclaimed security page by clicking on the <strong>Suggest edits</strong> link. A HackerOne staff will review your changes and approve them if they are valid. </p>',frontmatter:{path:"/programs/security-page",title:"Security Page"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
