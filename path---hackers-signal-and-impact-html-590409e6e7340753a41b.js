Reputation is gained based on the relative size of the awarded bounty, making Impact an aggregate representation of report severity.</p>\n<p>Signal provides a means of identifying hackers who\'ve had consistently valid reports while Impact highlights those with the greatest severity.

Alice will see that she is doing quite well with her current trajectory, while Bob will see that others are more accurate about their reports and can adjust his reporting processes accordingly.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Signal and Impact",id:"hackers/signal-and-impact",path:"/hackers/signal-and-impact.html",description:null}}},pathContext:{}}}});
