How fast you receive your payout depends on the type of payment you're using as well as your bank. There's cases where hackers have received payments on the same day and cases where hackers have had to wait the full 10 business days. Bank transfers can be done in your own local currency. To convert bounties to your local currency, the mid-market rate is used to convert money. This saves you up to 5% compared to relying on your bank to convert the money to your local currency.\n</br>\n<br>\nMake sure your bank isn’t on the sanctions list. Go to \n<a href=\"https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/\">https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/</a>\n to check to see if your bank is on the list. Banks on this list don’t qualify for bank transfers.
