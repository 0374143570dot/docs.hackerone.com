All weaknesses are shown by default and are organized in clusters (a set of weaknesses). To edit vulnerability display preferences, click <strong>Edit</strong> and you can choose from these options: <br><ul><li>Show: Reports can be submitted. You can add a contextual message if you have extra instructions or information pertaining to the weakness. Hackers can see the extra instructions on the submission page after selection.</li><li>Hide: The weakness isn't shown on the submission page and is not available to be selected by hackers.</li><li>Disable: The weakness will be displayed, but reports with this weakness can't be submitted. This option is often used if there is a common weakness type you've decided to put out of scope and you wish to attach an explanation of why this weakness type is out of scope. </li></ul></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Click <strong>Update introduction and template</strong>.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"path":"/programs/submit-report-form.html","id":"programs/submit-report-form","title":"Submit Report Form","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
