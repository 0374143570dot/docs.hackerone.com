How can I integrate with Jira?</td>\n<td>To use the bi-directional Jira integration, you need to make sure your Jira instance is accessible from the HackerOne system. You can whitelist HackerOneâ€™s IP addresses in your firewall to only open it up to the HackerOne application. Contact your program manager to request our IP addresses to whitelist in your firewall.<br><br>If you don't want to expose your Jira to HackerOne, <a href=\"https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\">contact us</a> to get a work-around that enables you to only escalate to Jira.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I'm getting the following error when creating a Jira issue: <code>JIRA returned the following error: \"You must specify a summary of the issue.\"</code></td>\n<td>This means that you didn't specify a value for the <code>summary</code> field in your Jira integration settings. Please review the field mapping in your Jira integration settings and make sure values are provided for all required fields.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I'm using a reverse proxy and can't connect to Jira.</td>\n<td>To use the Jira integration, you need to configure Jira to allow this. You can follow the documentation provided by <a href=\"https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/reverse-proxy-and-application-link-troubleshooting-guide-719095279.html\">Atlassian</a>.

Can I restrict the integration to only specific projects/spaces?</td>\n<td>Yes, you can. The easiest way to do this is by creating a new \"h1-integration\" user that only has access to the projects you want to expose to the integration with HackerOne.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","frontmatter":{"path":"/programs/jira-faqs.html","id":"programs/jira-faqs","title":"Jira FAQs","description":null},"headings":[]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
