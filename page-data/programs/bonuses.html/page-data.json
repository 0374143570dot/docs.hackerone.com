The hacker will be given an adjusted amount of reputation based on the bounty amount.</p>\n<p>Bonuses are used purely for cases when you're awarding for issues not related to bug severity.</p>\n<h3>Use Cases of Awarding a Bonus</h3>\n<h4>High Quality Reports</h4>\n<p>Did you receive a report from a hacker that was exceptionally useful? In addition to the bounty, reward a bonus, to show the hacker that they went above and beyond the call of duty. Programs can publicly disclose these reports to show other hackers the kind of report that can earn a bonus.</p>\n<h4>Specific Requests</h4>\n<p>Did a hacker help you verify that an issue was resolved appropriately? Did the hacker format the report according to your instructions? Awarding a bonus is a great way to positively reinforce the kind of behavior you find most helpful from hackers.</p>\n<h4>Promotions</h4>\n<p>The bonus feature makes it easy for programs to run a promotion during a specific time frame or to add extra incentives for issues found within a desired product or feature. Use bonuses to offer additional incentives to focus hackers on the scope you care most about.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/programs/bonuses.html","id":"programs/bonuses","title":"Bonuses","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
